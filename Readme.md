OData4ObjC
==================
OData4ObjC is an open-source toolkit to access and manipulate OData in Objective C.

This SDK supports up to iOS 7.


SetUp Instructions
==================
* Dowload latest zip edition
* Unzip folder and move to suitable location (ex: Documents folder, renamed folder to ODataSDK)

Set-up XCode:
* Open XCode project
* Add framework "libMSODataLib.a" (ex: found at ODataSKD/Framework/bin/odatalib/lib/iPhoneDeviceLibs/iPhone_Device_6.1/release )
* Add Search Paths
	- Select Project
	- Select project under TARGETS
	- Go to Build Settings -> Search Paths
	- Add include folder to "Header Search Paths" and choose recursive
	  (ex: "$(SRCROOT)/../../../../Documents/ODataSDK/Framework/bin/odatalib/include")
	- Add appropriate iPhoneSimulatorLibrary and choose non-recursive
	  (ex "$(SRCROOT)/../../../../Documents/ODataSDK/Framework/bin/odatalib/lib/iPhoneSimulatorLibs/iPhone_Simulator_6.1/release")
* In Build Settings -> Linking
  - Set "Mach-O Type" to "Executable"

Build OData Proxy:
* Validate OData endpoint is up and running. Copy the url
* In the command line, navigate to MacOSX10.8.sdk/Release (ex: ODataSDK/Framework/bin/ODatagenBinary/MacOSX10.8.sdk/Release)
* Execute "./odatagen /uri=http://MYURL/example.svc/ /out=."
* Move generated .h and .m files to XCode folder
* Add .h and .m files to XCode (right-click project file and select "Add Files")


Usage Instructions
==================

The SDK will run on Mac OSX machines only.

Further documentation on how to use the OData toolkit (the original version that only supported up to iOS 4) for Objective-C can be found in the [project web site](http://odata.github.com/OData4ObjC/).
